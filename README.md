Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker

**DOCUMENTATION:**

Website Description:
  - The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker Website aims to aid in the vaccine registration of people. This website was created for a hospital or an organization that will handle the vaccination of people in their area. 

Website Functions:
  - Customer:
    - Registration: They can register for the vaccination by heading to the registration page, and are able to check their status as well.
    - Log-in: They can log-in through the **link provided (below the registration button)** to check their vaccine registration status.
    - Edit: They can't edit or alter any of the information once the form is submitted.
    - Additional Information: There are also several pages found in the home page that contain information that they may want to know, such as FAQs, different vaccines available, policies that have been implemented, the status of COVID in the country, and others.
  
  - Administration:
    - Registration: They can register or create a new account to be used for accessing the records.
    - Log-in: They can log-in through the **button on the upper right of the screen** to access all records and perform functions. This button will redirect them to the log-in page that will only accept their data. If a customer tries to log-in through this page, it will be invalid.
    - Edit: Admins have the ability to update a person's record but only their vaccination status, such as "1st Dose" and "2nd Dose", and the vaccine they received (assuming that the person has been vaccinated already).
    - Delete: Admins are also able to delete a person's record, so that they will not have any copy of anyone's personal information. This action is irreversible, however. 

*It must be noted that the log-in function for both sides is not as secure as session was not used. Both must still log-in for access.
